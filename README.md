# LR(1) tables generator
*Under construction*

This generator is written in Rust and is particularly inefficient. Efficiency
isnâ€™t its goal, but I could see myself improving it in the future. The reason
it turned out this way is the chosen language. If I had known it before, I
might have used another language.

**TODO**
 - Refactor/clean
